\chapter{Preface}

In this document the reader can find a proposal for designing a course on quantum mechanics in a qCraft learning environment. This is an assignment executed for a bachelor thesis. The document contains a table with general information, a short summary of the assignment, a detailed description of the assignment wth the rationale, the conceptual framework and the relevance, the design approach and a planning.

\chapter{Design approach}

A model which describes the process of developing educational resources is the Generic Model \cite{genericmodel} (see figure~\ref{fig:genmod}). It describes the phases Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation. This model will be partly used for this project. Because of time constraints and the limited size of the project it will only go as far as the horizontal bar of development, this will be elaborated further later in this chapter.

\section{Analyses}

The first step in the Generic Model \cite{genericmodel} is the step Analysis. In this step, data is gathered which is necessary for designing an effective solution. \citeA{smithragan} mention three different kinds of analysis, namely analyzing the learning context, analyzing the learners and analyzing the learning task.

\subsection{Analyzing the learning context}

A learning task always takes place in a certain learning context. In this case this is the middle school. It entails not only the place, but also the temporal and social environment \cite{smithragan}. The analysis of the learning context can provide the instructional needs and a description of the different factors influencing the instruction. With the instructional needs, the designer can establish the main learning goals for the instruction. The description of the learning environment can provide the learning opportunities and constraints which have to be taken into account for the instruction.

\subsection{Analyzing the learners}

The second analysis is that of the learners \cite{smithragan}. The purpose of this analysis is the characterization of the end user of the instruction, which is in this case the middle school students. For this analysis it is important to determine the similarities and differences between the learners. \citeA{smithragan} provide a list of factors which play a role in designing the instruction.

\subsection{Analyzing the learning task}

The final step is analyzing the learning task \cite{smithragan}. In this analysis the goals from the needs assessment during the analysis of the learning context have to be translated to test specifications, with which the content of the instruction can be established. In order to achieve these test specifications, first the type of learning has to be established. Having this established, the information-processing analysis can be conducted. Every type of learning has its own kind of information-processing analysis. When the information-processing analysis has been conducted, the next step is the prerequisite analysis. The outcome of this has to correspond to the outcome of the learner analysis. Finally, the learning objectives can be written, which form the test specifications. Every learning objective has to contain a description of the terminal behavior or actions that will demontsrate learning, a description of the conditions of demonstration of that action and a description of the standard or criterion \cite{smithragan}. Every learning objective will fall into a catagory of Bloom his taxanomy of learning objectives \cite{bloom}, and will use appropriate action verbs.
