	Abstract = {In this study, the author examines the extent to which an interactive engagement approach can reduce the gender gap in senior secondary school (SSS) (age 16-18 years) students' learning outcomes in quantum physics. One hundred and twenty one (male = 65; female = 56) SSS 3 students participated in this study. They were randomly selected from two senior secondary schools from the Ibadan North Local Government Area, Oyo State, Nigeria. There were two groups: the experimental group (interactive engagement) and the control group (traditional lecture method). Prior to the commencement of the experiment, students' scores in a previous examination conducted by their schools were collected and analysed. This was to determine the extent to which gender disparity had been narrowed after the experiment. Three hypotheses were tested. The data collected were analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The results show that, generally, the students in the interactive engagement group had higher},

	Abstract = {This study describes the use of the double-slit thought experiment as a diagnostic tool for probing physics teachers&apos; understanding. A total of 9 pre-service teachers and 18 in-service teachers with a variety of different experience in modern physics teaching at the upper secondary level responded in a paper-and-pencil test and three of these teachers were interviewed. The results showed that the physics teachers&apos; thought experiments with classical particles, light, and electrons were often partial. Many teachers also suffered a lack of the basic ideas and principles of physics, which probably hindered thought experimenting. In particular, understanding the ontological nature of classical particles, light and electrons seemed to be essential in performing the double-slit experiment in an appropriate way. However, the in-service physics teachers who had teaching experience in modern physics were more prepared for the double-slit thought experiment than the pre-service teacher},

@article{barnes,
	Abstract = {In this article we use the pendulum as the vehicle for discussing the transition from classical to quantum physics. Since student knowledge of the classical pendulum can be generalized to all harmonic oscillators, we propose that a quantum analysis of the pendulum can lead students into the unanticipated consequences of quantum phenomena at the atomic level. We intend to illustrate how classical deterministic physical ideas are replaced by a point of view that contains both deterministic and probabilistic aspects. For example, the wave function contains probabilistic information but it evolves in time according to a fixed law, the Schrodinger equation. Discussion of the transition from classical to quantum thinking is historically grounded in the work of twentieth-century physicists who developed quantum ideas. We see application to current science in areas such as semiconductors, optics, GPS systems, and superconductivity. Our notion is that a scientifically-literate public should ha},

	Abstract = {Even though philosophical themes in science education have been advocated for several decades, little attention has been paid to how these themes can be contextualized in the teaching of a particular domain of science. The purpose of this paper is to provide an example theoretical framework for applying a philosophical theme, reduction, in chemistry education. The inclusion of the concept "reduction" in chemistry education not only elaborates on this important philosophical thesis in the specific context of chemistry but also it might offer some insight into how students' interest in philosophical aspects of chemistry might be stimulated. The consideration of concepts such as chemical composition, molecular structure and bonding in chemistry of water provides an example for the application of "reduction" in chemistry education. The water example also promotes the reflection on the microscopic, macroscopic and symbolic features of substances, themes which are repeatedly covered in seco},

	Abstract = {Nonlocality arises from the unified "all or nothing" interactions of a spatially extended field quantum such as a photon or an electron. In the double-slit experiment with light, for example, each photon comes through both slits and arrives at the viewing screen as an extended but unified energy bundle or "field quantum." When the photon interacts (randomly) with the screen, field quantization requires it to alter its state instantaneously rather than gradually. Thus if the photon is absorbed, it must vanish or "collapse" nonlocally and instantaneously across a macroscopic portion of the screen, even across many kilometers in the case of interference patterns of light from a small distant star. The interaction instantly transfers the photons energy to a single atom of the screen. But a quantized field can contain any whole number of "excitations" (particles such as photons or electrons). If a single field quantum contains, say, two excitations, then generally the unified all-or-nothin},

With many of the conceptual difficulties being unavoidable, simplifying the mathematics becomes top priority. The particle/wave-in-a-box provides a teaching model which includes many aspects of serious quantum physics, while avoiding most of the mathematics. In a Dutch quantum physics project for secondary schools, this model was adopted to play a key role. Much to our surprise, we ran into many more applications than we originally expected. In many instances the model yields order of magnitude estimates, for instance of atomic and nuclear size, or qualitative insights, for instance about energy levels, molecular bonding and electron pressure. Moreover, either directly or with minor modifications, the particle-in-a-box model provides reasonable approximations of a range of phenomena, including the absorption spectra of organic pigments, the mass of },

	Abstract = {This article reports on the third year of a three-year longitudinal investigation into six secondary students' understanding of optics at a secondary school level. In the third year of this investigation the students, who by now were in Year 12, underwent a teaching sequence that centred on the teaching and learning of physical optics and quantum ideas. The students' mental models of the nature of light were explored prior to, and following this teaching sequence. The researcher took on the dual roles of teacher and researcher. This paper will outline the findings of the third year of this study and the implications they have for the teaching and learning of optics at secondary school level.},

	Abstract = {In April 2005 the World Year of Physics (Einstein Year in the UK and Ireland) was celebrated with an Einstein week in Stockholm House of Science. Seven experiments illustrated Einstein's remarkable work in 1905 on Brownian motion, the photoelectric effect and special relativity. Thirteen school classes with 260 pupils, 30 teachers and 25 members of the general public took part in the different activities. The experiments and the Einstein theme have become an appreciated part of the modern physics activities in House of Science. This shows that physics themes with a set of related experiments have a role to play in school education.},

	Abstract = {In contrast to most other thermodynamic data, entropy values are not given in relation to a certain--more or less arbitrarily defined--zero level. They are listed in standard thermodynamic tables as absolute values of specific substances. Therefore these values describe a physical property of the listed substances. One of the main tasks of chemistry is to understand physical properties with respect to the internal structure of the substances. This comprises issues such as the kind of chemical bonding, particle masses, bond distances, bond forces, molecular volume, density, electronegativity, and so forth. A quantum physical approach on the basis of energy quantization leads to three simple rules, which will be elaborated in this article and which are key to understanding the physical property described by molar entropy values. Substances form a system that is able to store energy if work or heat are added to the system. It is shown that entropy describes the extent of the energy stori},

Bell's theorem can be displayed with a simple, nonmathematical thought experiment suitable for a physics course at "any" level. And a simple, semi-classical derivation of the quantum theory result can be given for physics students. These entanglement phenomena are today applied in industrial laboratories and are increasingly discussed in the popular literature. Unfortunately, they are also misappropriated by the purveyors of pseudoscience, something physicists have a responsibility to address. Students can be intrigued by the quantum strangeness physics has encountered at a boundary of our discipline.},

This phenomenon perplexes high school physics students and leads to the subsequent exploratory question, "Why are the four vials emitting a different color light if they all contain the same material and are illuminated with the same light source?" That question gives students the opportunity to collect and analyze data, which leads to the development of the inherent scientific concept that the color of the emitted light depends on the size of the material (quantum dot) suspended in solution.},

The paper presents examples of dangerous simplifications in the teaching of quantum physics. Then, examples of productive forms of complexity are discussed, both as criteria for designing teaching proposals, and for realizing appropriate learning environments, namely properly complex territories. Empirical results, from a teaching/learning experiment on quantum physics at upper secondary school (grade 13), are reported. These results show examples of students&apos; reactions to travelling through a complex territory, and allow us to argue that unavoidable difficulty in learning quantum physics can be transformed into cultural challenges within reach of secondary school students.},
