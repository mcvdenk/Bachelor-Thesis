  Abstract                 = {In this study, the author examines the extent to which an interactive engagement approach can reduce the gender gap in senior secondary school (SSS) (age 16-18 years) students' learning outcomes in quantum physics. One hundred and twenty one (male = 65; female = 56) SSS 3 students participated in this study. They were randomly selected from two senior secondary schools from the Ibadan North Local Government Area, Oyo State, Nigeria. There were two groups: the experimental group (interactive engagement) and the control group (traditional lecture method). Prior to the commencement of the experiment, students' scores in a previous examination conducted by their schools were collected and analysed. This was to determine the extent to which gender disparity had been narrowed after the experiment. Three hypotheses were tested. The data collected were analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The results show that, generally, the students in the interactive engagement group had higher},

  Abstract                 = {This study describes the use of the double-slit thought experiment as a diagnostic tool for probing physics teachers&apos; understanding. A total of 9 pre-service teachers and 18 in-service teachers with a variety of different experience in modern physics teaching at the upper secondary level responded in a paper-and-pencil test and three of these teachers were interviewed. The results showed that the physics teachers&apos; thought experiments with classical particles, light, and electrons were often partial. Many teachers also suffered a lack of the basic ideas and principles of physics, which probably hindered thought experimenting. In particular, understanding the ontological nature of classical particles, light and electrons seemed to be essential in performing the double-slit experiment in an appropriate way. However, the in-service physics teachers who had teaching experience in modern physics were more prepared for the double-slit thought experiment than the pre-service teacher},

  Abstract                 = {In this article we use the pendulum as the vehicle for discussing the transition from classical to quantum physics. Since student knowledge of the classical pendulum can be generalized to all harmonic oscillators, we propose that a quantum analysis of the pendulum can lead students into the unanticipated consequences of quantum phenomena at the atomic level. We intend to illustrate how classical deterministic physical ideas are replaced by a point of view that contains both deterministic and probabilistic aspects. For example, the wave function contains probabilistic information but it evolves in time according to a fixed law, the Schrodinger equation. Discussion of the transition from classical to quantum thinking is historically grounded in the work of twentieth-century physicists who developed quantum ideas. We see application to current science in areas such as semiconductors, optics, GPS systems, and superconductivity. Our notion is that a scientifically-literate public should ha},

The inclusion of the concept "reduction" in chemistry education not only elaborates on this important philosophical thesis in the specific context of chemistry but also it might offer some insight into how students' interest in philosophical aspects of chemistry might be stimulated. The consideration of concepts such as chemical composition, molecular structure and bonding in chemistry of water provides an example for the application of "reduction" in chemistry education.

We present the ReleQuant project, in which web-based teaching modules have been developed. The modules address competence aims in the Norwegian national curriculum for physics (final year of upper secondary education), which is unique in that it includes general relativity, entangled photons and the epistemological consequences of modern physics. These topics, with their high demands on students&apos; understanding of abstract and counter-intuitive concepts and principles, are challenging for teachers to teach and for students to learn. However, they also provide opportunities to present modern physics in innovative ways that students may find motivating and relevant both in terms of modern technological applications and in terms of contributions to students&apos; intellectual development.

In the double-slit experiment with light, for example, each photon comes through both slits and arrives at the viewing screen as an extended but unified energy bundle or "field quantum." When the photon interacts (randomly) with the screen, field quantization requires it to alter its state instantaneously rather than gradually. Thus if the photon is absorbed, it must vanish or "collapse" nonlocally and instantaneously across a macroscopic portion of the screen, even across many kilometers in the case of interference patterns of light from a small distant star. The interaction instantly transfers the photons energy to a single atom of the screen. But a quantized field can contain any whole number of "excitations" (particles such as photons or electrons). If a single field quantum contains, say, two excitations, then generally the unified all-or-nothin},

With many of the conceptual difficulties being unavoidable, simplifying the mathematics becomes top priority. The particle/wave-in-a-box provides a teaching model which includes many aspects of serious quantum physics, while avoiding most of the mathematics. In a Dutch quantum physics project for secondary schools, this model was adopted to play a key role. Much to our surprise, we ran into many more applications than we originally expected. In many instances the model yields order of magnitude estimates, for instance of atomic and nuclear size, or qualitative insights, for instance about energy levels, molecular bonding and electron pressure. Moreover, either directly or with minor modifications, the particle-in-a-box model provides reasonable approximations of a range of phenomena, including the absorption spectra of organic pigments, the mass of },

This comprises issues such as the kind of chemical bonding, particle masses, bond distances, bond forces, molecular volume, density, electronegativity, and so forth. A quantum physical approach on the basis of energy quantization leads to three simple rules, which will be elaborated in this article and which are key to understanding the physical property described by molar entropy values. Substances form a system that is able to store energy if work or heat are added to the system. It is shown that entropy describes the extent of the energy stori},

And a simple, semi-classical derivation of the quantum theory result can be given for physics students. These entanglement phenomena are today applied in industrial laboratories and are increasingly discussed in the popular literature. Unfortunately, they are also misappropriated by the purveyors of pseudoscience, something physicists have a responsibility to address.

  Abstract                 = {Part 1 of the findings are presented of a quantitative study (n = 125) on basic quantum chemical concepts taught in the twelfth grade (age 17-18 years) in Greece. A paper-and-pencil test of fourteen questions was used. The study compared performance in five questions that tested recall of knowledge or application of algorithmic procedures (type-A questions) with that on nine questions that required conceptual understanding and/or critical thinking (type-C questions). Performance in type-A questions was relatively high, ranging from 59.2 to 74.4%. With the exception of one double-choice question, performance in the type-C questions was generally much lower, ranging from 11.6 to 37.5%. Results of statistical principal component analysis and of analysis of variance confirmed the division of the questions into the two types, A and C. A large portion of the students (36.8%) could answer only algorithmic questions, while there were few students who exhibited both abilities (6.4%) or only th},

  Abstract                 = {Part 2 of the findings are presented of a quantitative study (n = 125) on basic quantum chemical concepts taught at twelfth grade (age 17-18 years) in Greece. A paper-and-pencil test of fourteen questions was used that were of two kinds: five questions that tested recall of knowledge or application of algorithmic procedures (type-A questions); plus nine questions that required conceptual understanding and/or critical thinking (type-C questions). As a rule, performance in type-A questions was relatively high while in the type-C questions it was much lower. Unacceptable performance in type-A questions was mainly caused by the application of a wrong algorithm or by partial answers. Analysis of the individual type-C questions led to the identification of common errors, misconceptions and difficulties in understanding. The Bohr model and the language of the old quantum theory featured prominently in the answers of many students, while other students were holding hybrid models, mixing the p},

A further point of investigation is whether TEs--as presented in popular physics books--can be used as an introduction to familiarize secondary school students with physics theories of the 20th century. The study of textbooks and popular physics books showed that authors of both types of books consider TEs as an important tool when presenting the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. Furthermore, a qualitative research conducted in secondary education revealed that the historical TEs which were transformed into forms accessible to the public could trigger students' interest and act as educational material to familiarize them with concepts and principles of the 20th century physics.},
